# ScratchXArchive
Archive of most extensions on ScratchX

# Hello
So, what is this? It's an archive of all the extensions I could grab from ScratchX, plus some of the other files, if you want to grab the sample project, documentation, grab  info, other stuff, ect, sure, just go to https://scratchfoundation.github.io/scratchx/#extensions and find a link you want, like this Arduino sample project, which is:  
https://scratchfoundation.github.io/scratchx/?url=https://khanning.github.io/scratch-arduino-extension/examples/Arduino%20Example%20-%20Blink%20an%20LED.sbx  
Going there just takes you to the main page, as the Flash player doesn't exist on the site, so grab the part after ?url=, which would be:  
https://khanning.github.io/scratch-arduino-extension/examples/Arduino%20Example%20-%20Blink%20an%20LED.sbx  
Going there lets you download it, sometimes (like on https://eesh.github.io/clarifai-scratch/), you can't find the link, or the link doesn't exist, well, just go to the normal  Github version, swap .io for .com, move the part before github to after the .io/ and before the actual project name like this:  
https://github.com/eesh/clarifai-scratch/  
Going there actually takes you to the place where you can download it, but in this case, the actual extension is at https://eesh.github.io/scratch-test/clarifai.js, which is  referenced in the .js  
Ok, have fun now!
